    - Drag and drop isn't mobile-friendly
    - You can't insert a new node in a specific place
    - You can't move nodes into other nodes as new children
    - Relies on 3rd-party CDN (for FontAwesome) 
    - Changes are not saved permanently, so they will be lost after a server restart
    - Light theme is kinda ugly
    - Websocket reconnection is janky (it just reloads the whole page lol)
- FAQ
    - Where's the source code?
        - Coming soon
    - What is this for?
        - Note-taking
    - What does "pn" mean?
        - "pxeger's notes"
    - Why is there no HTTPS?
        - Sorry. This is just an artefact of how I'm hosting it for now; I couldn't be bothered to set up HTTPS
    - Why is there no authentication?
        - This is not really designed for very-multi-user use
        - Authentication is a solved problem, and can just be implemented independently of the app itself, using a reverse proxy
