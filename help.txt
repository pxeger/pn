    - Drag and drop isn't mobile-friendly
    - You can't insert a new node in a specific place without enabling JavaScript
    - You can't move nodes into other nodes as new children
    - Relies on 3rd-party CDN (for FontAwesome)
    - Changes are not saved permanently, so they will be lost after a server restart
    - Light theme is kinda ugly
    - Websocket reconnection is janky (it just reloads the whole page lol)
- FAQ
    - Where's the source code?
        - https://github.com/pxeger/pn
    - What is this for?
        - Note-taking
    - What does "pn" mean?
        - "pxeger's notes"
    - Why is there no authentication?
        - This is not really designed for very-multi-user use
        - Authentication is a solved problem, and can just be implemented independently of the app itself, using a reverse proxy
